# My First Automation Project 
This will be my first automation project in which I will automate this website https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-playground/ with the help of javascript and webdriver IO tool

Another thing to practice is about the github and its commands
- git add .
- git status 
- git push but to make myself an authorized user for the git  I have to create an ssh key and I used this guide to add ssh key https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=windows so that whatever changes I make in the folder, can easily be pushed to the git repo.
