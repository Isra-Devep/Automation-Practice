# My First Automation Project 
This will be my first automation project in which I will automate this website https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-playground/ with the help of javascript and webdriver IO tool

Another thing to practice is about the github and its commands
- git add .
- git status 
- git push but to make myself an authorized user for the git so that whatever changes I make in the folder can easily be pushed to the git repo
