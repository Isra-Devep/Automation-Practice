#Another useful instruction 
- So you have opened you folder on the vS code , you made changes and you did git push but git is unable to find which repo you have pushed your own changes so for that you will use this command "git remote add origin ssh link"
- Sometimes there are some changes  I have made on the github and some changes on local so in order to sync both local and live one we have to do "git pull"
- After git pull we will do "git push"
